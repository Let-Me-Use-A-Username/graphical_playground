# About
Geometrical is a small and simple shoot-em-up game, where you handle a character with car like mechanics. Attached to you
are two guns, a shield and a movement boost that works well only when moving slowly. Additionally you have the ability to drift, 
the rest figure out on your own!

# Mechanics
The game is only playable by using keyboard and mouse, and at the moment, controls can't be configured with.

## Keyboard
- <strong>W/S</strong>:  Forwards/Backwards movement
- <strong>A/D</strong>:  Left/Right rotation
- <strong>Space</strong>:  Handbrake.
- <strong>Left Shift</strong>:  Movement boost. Works better when velocity is small.


## Mouse
- <strong>Left Mouse button</strong>: Fire guns interchangebly.
- <strong>Right Mouse button</strong>: Shield yourself.
