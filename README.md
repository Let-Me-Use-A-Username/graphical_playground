Graphical playground is a project of self-learning, in an attempt to create an arcade-like game by using as few dependencies as possible, in hopes of creating an *engine-less* game.

The game itself is the 3rd iteration of __*Geometrical*__, a simple shoot-em-up game that I previously made using Godot, and before that Unity.
