================== General todo ==============

-Tested the game.
    - Enemies:
        - Rect:
            - Provides no knockback on hit (with or no shield)
        - Hexagon:
            - Either make it a boss
            - Or less appearances

- Bullets can travel outside of grid space. *What happens to them?*

- When player close to wall, enemies can spawn on wall. *Keep(?)*

- In release version, *player movement feels different*. Test it

- Add game icon 

- Create Linux version

==============================================
================== Testing ===================
- Test in Player Drift:
    - When drifting, letting go off forwards / backwards,  turning, and 
        then applying Forwards/backwards input, increaes velocity
            - *UNSURE whether I want to keep this*
            - *Player Test ???*
            - Partially fixed by applying stronger deceleration in drifting when not throttling 

- Test in Player movement
    - Forwards and backwards directions maintain acceleration. Switching from W/D provides no deceleration
            - *UNSURE whether I want to keep this*
            - *Player Test ???*

- Test Tinker ranges on variables.
 
==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======

==============================================
================== Notes =====================
- If *memory leaks* occur in the future, there is a chance that one of the following will be at fault
    - Event queue is pushed faster than consumed
    - Grids operation queue doesn't drain properly
    - Emitters aren't dropped correctly from MetalArtist
    - Cyrcle Arc references inside game manager
    - MetalArtists Config is set to one shot but spawns every frame. (RectMove incident)

- Colliders:
    - Projectile colliders extend past the sprite, only forward.

================== Study =====================
