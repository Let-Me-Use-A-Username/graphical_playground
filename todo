==============================================
================== Critical ==================
- Implement EntityHandler
- Implement a way to detect collitions
    - Either the way it was or have a dedicated system (check Implementation ideas)
- Implement communication between game components via Events
- Refactor update loop

==============================================
================== General todo ==============
- Implement fullscreen with  macroquad::prelude::Conf
    - Function macroquad::window::set_fullscreen ?
        - When settings are changed, restart game to run them?
- Implement better UI


==============================================
================== Gameplay ==================



==============================================
================== Gameplay Design and Ideas==
- Implement dash with background beat ( Bloukos ) that can vary to be faster or quicker (difficulty?) and dashing on the rythem enchances it
- Draw non-complete shapes to imitate "zombie" like creatures. I.e. circle with transparent circle top left to imitate a 3/4 circle.


==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======
- Change collition detection (Square collider ?)
- Add a shape to enemies. If their shape overlaps another, distance them.
    - Trait collidable? 
        - New game component that is dedicated to checking collitions?
- Update enemies only when move or active or inside view(?)s

- Add threads to independent tasks (grid, factory, collition detection) be careful with shared data
- Use a thread per cell grid. Assign a structure per cell that gived information on either: Enemy pos and last pos, or cell status (populated, not)
    -When enemies exceed a certai number in a cell, divide the cell (and only this cell) with size 32 into 4 sub cells with size 8. One thread per subcell
    - Dynamic cell resize?
