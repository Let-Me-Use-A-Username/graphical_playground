================== Critical ==================
- GPU
    -Implement artist for Emitters (player)
        -Consider that, many entities might have a few emitters to display different effects.
        -Many configs perhaps and swap configs?
            -So MetalArtist would have to keep a config file as well. <id, Conf>

- Rework player Hit state. (Bounce doesn't occur)
- Change MetalArtist to save/delete configs AND update emitters via update

==============================================
================== General todo ==============
- Verify following work correctly.
    - Bullet pool refill (Once the bullets stopped firing)

- Implement ErrorHandler 

- Implement different kind of enemies.

- Refine Artist draw method.
    -Compare the two methods, if nothing works implement something different.


==============================================
================== Gameplay ==================
- Implement firing angle modifier based on mouse scroll. Instead of literally zooming.
- Refine handbrake
- Implement boost


==============================================
================== Gameplay Design and Ideas==
- Draw non-complete shapes to imitate "zombie" like creatures. I.e. circle with transparent circle top left to imitate a 3/4 circle.


==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======
- Implement build parameters
    - Debug mode
        - Enable/Disable tracy

- Implement better UI
    - Implement fullscreen with  macroquad::prelude::Conf
        - Function macroquad::window::set_fullscreen ?
            - When settings are changed, restart game to run them (hot reload)
    - Draw bullet ammunition UI
