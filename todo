================== Critical ==================
        
- Implement boost
    - Very basic implementation added 
    - https://claude.ai/chat/2a087df5-d1e8-4b35-8892-0a3098bb0b36
        - Add timer
        - Variable boost?
        - Drifting boost will be side ways rather than forward?

- Consider changing state machine to be an enum type
    - Enemy Machine
    - Object machine
    - Player machine etc


==============================================
================== General todo ==============

- Implement ErrorHandler
    -Change component function to return Results 
        -Log these results if error occurs

- Implement different kinds of enemies.

==============================================
================== Gameplay ==================



==============================================
================== Testing ===================
- Player Test
    -Test handbrake mechanic(Check forward and lateral friction)
        -Faster or slower? (if faster revert to old frictions, else increase them)
        -Turns too much or too little?
    -Test Players base turn rate (rotation when not drifting)
    -Not inputting movement losses velocity too fast
    -Bullet collider might not be overlapping sprite
-Test Results
    - Max speed too much
    - Max acceleration too much
    - Normal turn is too much
    - Firing too quickly

- Component Test
    - MetalArtist:
        - Monitor memory usage (especially freed memory)

==============================================
================== Gameplay Design and Ideas==
- Draw non-complete shapes to imitate "zombie" like creatures. I.e. circle with transparent circle top left to imitate a 3/4 circle.
- Implement firing angle modifier based on mouse scroll. Instead of literally zooming.
- Implement Tinkering menu for different player-based aspects, variables, skins, sounds etc

==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======
- Implement build parameters
    - Debug mode
        - Enable/Disable tracy

- Implement better UI
    - Implement fullscreen with  macroquad::prelude::Conf
        - Function macroquad::window::set_fullscreen ?
            - When settings are changed, restart game to run them (hot reload)
    - Draw bullet ammunition UI

==============================================
================== Notes =====================
- If *memory leaks* occur in the future, there is a chance that one of the following will be at fault
    - Event queue is pushed faster than consumed
    - Grids operation queue doesn't drain properly
    - Emitters aren't dropped correctly from MetalArtist
    - Cyrcle Arc references inside game manager

==============================================
================== Study =====================
- Entity component system
