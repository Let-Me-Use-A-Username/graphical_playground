==============================================
================== Critical ==================
- RectCollider could be wrong due to there being no rotation 
    - Affects bullet
- Circles implementation of overide might be bad, or distance in handler should be increased

- Implement enemy collision
    - Handler now has a hashmap (change to Vecdeque) that queue overides 
    - Enemies have their move_to overides to a different target
    - Either 
        1) This overide needs to be timed for a few seconds
        2) The radius check inside Handler is small/wrong

==============================================
================== General todo ==============
- Implement build parameters
    - Debug mode
        - Enable/Disable tracy

- Implement better UI
    - Implement fullscreen with  macroquad::prelude::Conf
        - Function macroquad::window::set_fullscreen ?
            - When settings are changed, restart game to run them (hot reload)
    - Draw bullet ammunition UI

- Implement correct ids for entities.

- Implement ErrorHandler 

- Implement different kind of enemies.

- Resource optimazation
    - Memory
        - Implement enemy pooling
        - ECS?
    - CPU
        - Replace some async functions with synchronous ones
    - GPU
        - Separation of draw calls (circle, rect etc)
        - Batch drawing instead of separate draw calls

==============================================
================== Gameplay ==================
- Implement firing angle modifier based on mouse scroll. Instead of literally zooming.
- Refine handbrake


==============================================
================== Gameplay Design and Ideas==
- Draw non-complete shapes to imitate "zombie" like creatures. I.e. circle with transparent circle top left to imitate a 3/4 circle.
