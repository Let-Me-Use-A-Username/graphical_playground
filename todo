================== Critical ==================
- Implement enemy collision
    - Enemies now implement a state machine.
        -When the detector emits a CollidingEnemies event, the handler forces the enemies to move in a certain way
        to avoid overlapping
            - Force state change to move and change move_to target?
        -When the detector emits a EnemyHit event, change so that the handler forces a state change to Hit
        and have the handler check if he the is_alive is false to remote it

    - Implement restriction to draw, based on range from player, with its field of view.
