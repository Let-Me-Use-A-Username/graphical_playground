================== Critical ==================
- Player Test
    -Test handbrake mechanic(Check forward and lateral friction)
        -Faster or slower? (if faster revert to old frictions, else increase them)
        -Turns too much or too little?
    -Test Players base turn rate (rotation when not drifting)
    -Not inputting movement losses velocity too fast


- Implement MetalArtist.
    -Reset permanent emitters when idle for long 
        -Implement new collection with stopwatch and count?
        -Emit event from entity to reset with config?
    -Projectile entities cant use MetalArtist because they don't have a state
==============================================
================== General todo ==============
- Implement additional States..?
    - MoveFire for player.. ?

- Verify following work correctly.
    - Bullet pool refill (Once the bullets stopped firing)
    - Factories enemies are spawning in player vision again, make queue smaller.
        - Let resizing happen on queue_size increase, since more entities will be drawn, the viewport offset will be less

- Implement ErrorHandler 

- Implement different kinds of enemies.

==============================================
================== Gameplay ==================
- Implement firing angle modifier based on mouse scroll. Instead of literally zooming.
- Implement boost


==============================================
================== Gameplay Design and Ideas==
- Draw non-complete shapes to imitate "zombie" like creatures. I.e. circle with transparent circle top left to imitate a 3/4 circle.


==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======
- Implement build parameters
    - Debug mode
        - Enable/Disable tracy

- Implement better UI
    - Implement fullscreen with  macroquad::prelude::Conf
        - Function macroquad::window::set_fullscreen ?
            - When settings are changed, restart game to run them (hot reload)
    - Draw bullet ammunition UI
