==============================================
================== Final Roadmap =============

==============================================
================== Critical ==================

==============================================
================== Current ===================
- Tinkerer `write_score` and `read_score` work differently
    than their counterparts. Fix this with yaml
    - First line is blank causing read to fail

- Implement better in-game UI by using textures.
    - Bullet texture
    - Shield texture


==============================================
================== General todo ==============

-Tested the game.
    - Enemies:
        - Rect:
            - Provides no knockback on hit (with or no shield)
        - Hexagon:
            - Either make it a boss
            - Or less appearances

- Implement small buffer between Menu - Playing


==============================================
================== Testing ===================
- Test in Player Drift:
    - When drifting, letting go off forwards / backwards,  turning, and 
        then applying Forwards/backwards input, increaes velocity
            - *UNSURE whether I want to keep this*
            - *Player Test ???*
            - Partially fixed by applying stronger deceleration in drifting when not throttling 

- Test in Player movement
    - Forwards and backwards directions maintain acceleration. Switching from W/D provides no deceleration
            - *UNSURE whether I want to keep this*
            - *Player Test ???*

- Test Tinker ranges on variables.

- In release version, player movement feels different. Test it

- Grid map edge requests
 
==============================================
================== Implementation ideas ======
- Performance enhancing ideas
    - Make an asynchronous and synchronous update loop


==============================================
================== Notes =====================
- If *memory leaks* occur in the future, there is a chance that one of the following will be at fault
    - Event queue is pushed faster than consumed
    - Grids operation queue doesn't drain properly
    - Emitters aren't dropped correctly from MetalArtist
    - Cyrcle Arc references inside game manager
    - MetalArtists Config is set to one shot but spawns every frame. (RectMove incident)

- Colliders:
    - Projectile colliders extend past the sprite, only forward.

==============================================
================== Study =====================
- Entity component system
